# MVP Design for AI-Powered Legal Tool for Freelancers

## Core "Killer Feature": AI-Powered Contract Generation with Legal Confidence

Based on comprehensive market research, legal pain point analysis, and competitive landscape assessment, the core feature that would make freelancers say "wow" is:

**Instant, legally-sound contract generation that adapts to 2025 regulations across jurisdictions while explaining legal terms in plain language.**

This feature directly addresses the most critical pain points identified:
- Upcoming regulatory changes in 2025 (CA FWPA, NY Freelance Isn't Free Act)

- Legal uncertainty and fear of vulnerability
- Need for professional appearance with clients

- **Visual confidence indicators** showing legal strength of each clause
- **2025 compliance badges** highlighting adherence to new regulations

### 2. Customization Interface

## Features to Exclude from Initial Release

### 1. Advanced Contract Management

- **Contract analytics dashboard** - Can be added in future versions

### 2. Complex Integrations

- **Accounting software connections** - Focus on legal aspects first, financial later
- **Calendar syncing** - Not essential for core value proposition

### 3. Advanced Collaboration
- **Client negotiation portal** - Too complex for MVP
- **Multi-user collaboration** - Focus on individual freelancers first
- **Team permissions** - Target solo freelancers initially

### 4. Secondary Document Types
- **Proposals** - Focus on contracts first, expand document types later
- **Invoices** - Many existing solutions; not a differentiator
- **NDAs** - Can be added as expansion after core contracts

## First User Interaction Design

The first user interaction should feel magical through:
